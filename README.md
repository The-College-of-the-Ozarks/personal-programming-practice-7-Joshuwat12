# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 7

---

Write functions to tackle the following problems in the given .py file. Helper code for inputing a list from the user and outputting results has been provided. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

1. Write a function called average that takes 1 parameter, a list, and returns the average of the list.
2. Write a function called largest that takes 1 parameter, a list, and returns the largest value in the list.

*You only have to complete the function definitions at the top of the file -- you may leave the input and output portions untouched! But you are welcome to explore and mess with the other code I provided as time allows.*
